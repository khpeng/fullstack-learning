<h2> Day 1 </h2>

<div>
work flow -> project structure -> pkg used (read doc 

head -> metadata
!doctype html -> define html5 

alt -> img alternative text if img not shown
disable -> for button, if condition not meet
title -> display as tool tip
DOM doc object model -> allows program and script to access and update content
display none ->remove element from dom ex: toggle click button twice will not show
visibility hidden ->not shown but would take place in dom

bagel to transpile es6 to es5

#a -> id selector
.a  ->  class
a  -> element

responsive web design -> provide optimal viewing experience, resizing, panning, scroll
bootstrap, media query 

Media query
@media only sceen and max-width ->  only less than xxx show 

JS -> Client side scripting language
Use strict 

naming convention:
usually remove  a,e,i,o,u

debugger; comon use break point
prompt, alert and confirm

always put script in the end so it can find element (html excute line by line

switch stop when reaches break;
pre increment vs post increment performance ?question

do while < 5 will  1+2+3+4+5

functiion expression vs declaration (hoisted)
const vs let: cannot reassign const


call, apply, bind
call(this, arg1, arg2)
apply(this, [argsArray])
bind(object you want to bind, arg)
splice()
</div>



<h2> Day 2 </h2>

<div>
Primitive(number, string...) vs reference(object):
  when b = a in object, it shares same memory
  then, to copy a reference use: deepclone, ...operator
  
 a = null;
 a;  is undefined
 why use const rather than var? question.
 
 <h3> JS advanced</h3>
 Scopre: 
 IIFE: immedate invoke function. only invoke once. when call only the return part invoke
 
 6 888 6 888 888
 
 in arrow function this is decalre when declaration 
 
 
 callback or promise for data getting. So it will get the data then process the rest
 
 async/await new feature in js.
 
 
 callback hell -> not readable not undestandable thats why use promise.
 what is prototype? to use for inheritance. because js is not oop. 
 
 CRUD
 get -> read 
 post -> create 
 put -> update
 delete -> d
 
 <b>const and let</b> adavantage: fix scope problem
 http is asynchro
 understand http request in js 
 
 Arrow function
 functionname = (parm1, parm2 ..) => {}
 
 
</div>
